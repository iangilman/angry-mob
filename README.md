# Angry Mob

This project is in early development. See [this post](http://blog.iangilman.com/2012/01/issue-tracking-for-real-world.html) for the basic premise, and [this comic](http://wondermark.com/894/) for the codename inspiration (though [we're still on the lookout](https://github.com/iangilman/angry-mob/issues/1) for a name to go live with).

You can see it in action at http://angry-mob-beta.appspot.com/

# To Do

* Tags
* Owner
* Region

* User pages
* Email notifications
* Feed/wall of all changes

* Sessions should last longer
* When signing in with Twitter, shouldn't have to reauthorize every time
* Validate forms before forcing login?
* Only show 10 most recent issues on front page
* Other login methods (Facebook, email)
* Support hash urls in old browsers
* Better error reporting than alert
* If you mob.navigate to a place that doesn't exist, nothing happens; should 404. Is this also a problem with anchor tags?
* Deleting issues?
* Edit: only highlight save button after you've made a change
* Unsubscribe from event in issue.js's destroy()
* Issue editor should be its own subview
