# Angry Mob

This project is in early development. See [this post](http://blog.iangilman.com/2012/01/issue-tracking-for-real-world.html) for the basic premise, and [this comic](http://wondermark.com/894/) for the name inspiration (though [we're still looking](https://github.com/iangilman/angry-mob/issues/1) for a name to go live with).
